### üåç Overview

**LLM-** is a structured repository focused on developing **reliable, measurable, and production-ready Generative AI and LLM systems**.  
It brings together practical experiments, small projects, and evaluations that explore how language models can be applied to tasks such as **retrieval**, **summarisation**, and **reasoning**.  

The aim is to go **beyond framework tutorials** ‚Äî to design **reproducible**, **evaluated**, and **responsibly built** systems with clear metrics, safety checks, and strong engineering practices.  
Each part of this repository represents hands-on learning, documentation, and iteration toward building smarter, safer, and more efficient LLM-based applications.
